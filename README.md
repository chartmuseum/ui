# ChartMuseumUI

ChartMuseumUI is a simple web app that (currently) provides GUI for your charts so you and your team can view and share the technologies your are using to any one at any time (in near future more capabilities will be added).
ChartMuseumUI was written in Go (Golang) with the help of Beego Framework.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you started with your very own private chart repository and UI.

### Usage

ChartMuseumUI uses [ChartMuseum](https://github.com/helm/chartmuseum) as a backend.
To get started quickly, you can build and run the app using docker-compose.

Clone this repo and run the following:

```
docker-compose up
```

This will start ChartMuseumUI at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
and ChartMuseum at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
Check out the source of [docker-compose.yaml](./docker-compose.yaml) and modify for your purposes.

Here is an example docker-compose file defining ChartMuseum with Amazon S3 as a storage and exposing ChartMuseumUI on port 80:
```
version: '2.0'
services:
   ui:
     image: idobry/chartmuseumui:latest
     environment:
      CHART_MUSESUM_URL: "http://chartmuseum:8080"
     ports:
      - 80:8080
   chartmuseum:
     image: chartmuseum/chartmuseum:latest
     volumes:
       - ~/.aws:/root/.aws:ro
     restart: always
     environment:
      PORT: 8080
      DEBUG: 1
      STORAGE: "amazon"
      STORAGE_AMAZON_BUCKET: "chartmuseum-bucket"
      STORAGE_AMAZON_PREFIX: ""
      STORAGE_AMAZON_REGION: "eu-west-1"
     ports:
      - 8080:8080
```

Copy this file and run

```
docker-compose up 
```
Easy, right? now, we can add our private repository to our Helm client:
```
# choose any name you like
$ helm repo add chartmuseum <chartmuseum-url>
$ helm repo update
# to view our repos list
$ helm repo list
NAME        URL
stable      https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com
incubator   http://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-charts-incubator
chartmuseum http://localhost:8080
```

Let's upload a chart into our private repository:

```
$ cd /chart/path
# create a chart package - this will create a .tgz file
$ helm package .
# copy packge name and run
$ curl -L --data-binary "@<packge-name>" <chartmuseum-url>/api/charts
```
   
In the browser, navigate to localhost and view your charts

### Using with ChartMuseum with Multitenancy enabled

To use ChartMuseumUI on a ChartMuseum with Multitenancy support enabled, add the following environment variable to ChartMuseumUI

```
CHART_MUSESUM_API_GET_CHARTS: "/api/org1/charts"
```

Currently only one organization is allowed per ChartMuseumUI.


### Adding authentication to ChartMuseumUI 

To add a simple basic auth to ChartMuseumUI, you can add the following configuration

```
BASIC_AUTH_USERS: '[{"username":"admin", "password":"password"}, {"username":"user", "password":"s3cr3t"}]'
```

### Adding back end authentication to ChartMuseumUI 

To add a back end credentials to be used by ChartMuseumUI, you can add the following configuration

```
BACKEND_BASIC_AUTH_USER: username
BACKEND_BASIC_AUTH_PASS: password
```
